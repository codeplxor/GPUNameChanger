# GPU Name Changer

![After Restart](afterestart.png)

🚀 **GPU Name Changer** is a Python script that allows you to rename your graphics card in Windows . This is useful for aesthetic reasons, testing, or personal customization.

## 🛠 Features
✅ Detects all installed GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, etc.)  
✅ Displays real GPU names before modification  
✅ Allows selection of a specific GPU or all GPUs for renaming  
✅ Edits the Windows Registry safely (requires admin rights)  
✅ Works with multiple GPUs (e.g., laptops with Intel + NVIDIA)  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
> This script doesn't modify your GPU internally , you can easily go back with resinstalling the driver.
> Some Games detects it some doesn't.
> I've made this Script to only show on Device Manager, Task Manager and other because everyone can fake and lose money on pc's with fake cards.
